  <p><h2><center><strong>Why did we create this website?</p></h2></center></strong>
  <p><h3><center>This website was created to educate and spread awareness about the 17 diiferent United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations aims to stop major worldwide problems so that Earth can sustain itself, but humans are not solving these problems fast enough to achieve these goals by the year 2030, which is why we made this website. We believe that everyone should know what the 17 UN SDG's are about and how we can act on them. We can also spread awareness on these goals and become an example to others for a better future. If we all work together, we can achieve these world goals by the year 2030. If we succeed, Earth can sustain itself and continue to host life for generations to come!</p></h3></center>
