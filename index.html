   <p><font size="4">What does sustainability mean?</p></font>
   <p><font size="4">Sustainability is a term used to describe the ability for any object to sustain or thrive under certain circumstances. However, humans have been depleting natural resources and keeping the world at stake. We must conserve our renewable and non-renewable resources, stop contaminating the Earth's various spheres with pollutants, and must conserve our own growth, otherwise Earth as we know it will not be able to host life.</p></font>
